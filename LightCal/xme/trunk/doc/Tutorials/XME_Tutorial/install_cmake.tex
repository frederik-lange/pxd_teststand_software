\end{figure}

	\item After downloading the setup, launch it. Follow the instructions on the screen.
		When you get prompted whether to add CMake to the system PATH, you may choose to \emph{not} add it
		(compare Figure~\ref{fig:setup_cmake_path}).
		\xme does not require CMake to be on the system search path.
